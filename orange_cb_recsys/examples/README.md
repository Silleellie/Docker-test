In this package you can observe a lot of framework's features at work, by simple but effective examples

### Example 1
Simple Content-Based recommender: Content analyzer configuration with tf idf representation and a Centroid recommender, evaluation with F2 measure, precision and recall

### Example 2
More advanced recommender, with a complex multiple field representation classifier recommender and evaluation using fairness metrics.

### Example 3
Focus on a graph based recommender using Page Rank algorithm for both graph feature selection and recommendation algorithm, evaluation done with prediction metrics.
